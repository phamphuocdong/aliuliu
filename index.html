									<h2>Interest in IT.</h2>
									<p>With the development of technologies, now there are lots of high-tech devices and online services that allow people to live in the most convenient world than ever. However, as a student, I do not really know how people create these things. And after I realized that IT is a part of these developments, including hardware, software, internet, telecom equipment, and many other related features, I can say that how I am impressed in information technology is how I got interested in it. My interest in IT start when I heard a lot about it from TV and also some reports from the internet say that how IT important to our life. And I started to research about IT. However, the result that I get from the internet can not answer my question about what IT really was, so I decided to study IT.
I chose to come to RMIT because it is an international school where I can both improve my English skills and gain experience for my future job. Moreover, in the future, I might work in the international environment so RMIT is a great place where I can get used to it. Currently, I am quite happy with my decision because RMIT actually provides me a great study environment because this school has good infrastructure and how people here working and interacting actually is the thing I need to learn from them a lot, most of them are very energetic.
During my university courses, besides gaining knowledge for my future career, I hope that I can improve my soft skills such as communication abilities, teamwork, and creative thinking. Also, I need to practice a lot so I can be more confident through my course in RMIT.

									<h2>Ideal job.</h2>
									<p>Link of the job: https://itviec.com/it-jobs/senior-python-dev-sql-up-to-1800-saigon-technology-solutions-5155?fbclid=IwAR0S3GZAuqWMM4FtlCmzXvgTyMNzp2lTXusaFanO4fe_c57c0_4EtGT5Y3Y</p>
									<p>As the advertisement of this position, I will be working directly with US client to implement features which is great because I like to interact and work with foreigners.
To apply for this position, I must have at least 3 years of experience in Python projects, experience in MS SQL Server and PostgreSQL, experience with data migration, architecture and algorithm knowledge, good at verbal and nonverbal English, able to work in an international environment, good at analyzing and problem-solving skills.
As a new student, I still do not have enough skills, qualifications, and experience that this position required but it does not mean that I do not have a plan for it. First, I will try to study hard and gain as much experience as possible, trying to practice coding by using Python and I will start to do some Python projects in order to exercise. Then, I will work unpaid for any company that I can get the experience that I needed. About English skills, I will practice it during my studying time through communicating, texting and in my leisure time through watching English movies. Finally, the rest of the skill required I will study about them soon in my school and I am considering taking some extra courses to get knowledge about architecture and some skills that I needed.
