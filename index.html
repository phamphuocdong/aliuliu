									<h2>Interest in IT.</h2>
									<p>With the development of technologies, now there are lots of high-tech devices and online services that allow people to live in the most convenient world than ever. However, as a student, I do not really know how people create these things. And after I realized that IT is a part of these developments, including hardware, software, internet, telecom equipment, and many other related features, I can say that how I am impressed in information technology is how I got interested in it. My interest in IT start when I heard a lot about it from TV and also some reports from the internet say that how IT important to our life. And I started to research about IT. However, the result that I get from the internet can not answer my question about what IT really was, so I decided to study IT.
I chose to come to RMIT because it is an international school where I can both improve my English skills and gain experience for my future job. Moreover, in the future, I might work in the international environment so RMIT is a great place where I can get used to it. Currently, I am quite happy with my decision because RMIT actually provides me a great study environment because this school has good infrastructure and how people here working and interacting actually is the thing I need to learn from them a lot, most of them are very energetic.
During my university courses, besides gaining knowledge for my future career, I hope that I can improve my soft skills such as communication abilities, teamwork, and creative thinking. Also, I need to practice a lot so I can be more confident through my course in RMIT.

									<h2>Personal profile.</h2>
									<p>The result of the personality test shows that I am the type of person that likes to be alone than engaging in a crowded place. I am good at noticing things, makes decisions based on my emotions, values and the needs of others. One another is that I can be slow in committing to some things because of uncertainty and the potential of everything else. Finally, the result shows that I am a success-driven, perfectionistic and eager to improve.
I think in a team, I will be quite helpful if we are doing any project because I am good at noticing things and eager to improve. However, it might not be good for the team if I make decisions based on my emotions and feelings. Therefore, when forming a team, I will choose teammates who can make decisions based on logic and facts.

									<p>As the advertisement of this position, I will be working directly with US client to implement features which is great because I like to interact and work with foreigners.
To apply for this position, I must have at least 3 years of experience in Python projects, experience in MS SQL Server and PostgreSQL, experience with data migration, architecture and algorithm knowledge, good at verbal and nonverbal English, able to work in an international environment, good at analyzing and problem-solving skills.
As a new student, I still do not have enough skills, qualifications, and experience that this position required but it does not mean that I do not have a plan for it. First, I will try to study hard and gain as much experience as possible, trying to practice coding by using Python and I will start to do some Python projects in order to exercise. Then, I will work unpaid for any company that I can get the experience that I needed. About English skills, I will practice it during my studying time through communicating, texting and in my leisure time through watching English movies. Finally, the rest of the skill required I will study about them soon in my school and I am considering taking some extra courses to get knowledge about architecture and some skills that I needed.

							<h2>Project!!</h2>
							<p>This is my ideas about a project which might be helpful for students.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Overview.</h3>
									<p>My project ideas are to make an application about education named Efficient Learning (EL). It can be used by parents, students, and teachers in order to support students to gain the best learning results. This is the studying application that is easy to use and people will probably feel that this is the tool that can help them study better. At some of the first few versions of this application, it just contains all of the content that we take from the official textbook of Vietnamese students from grades 1 to 12. Later on, if any countries want to collaborate with me, I will add their educational content to my application so they can also use it for their students.
</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Motivation.</h3>
									<p>My motivation for making this application is because when I am still studying from grade 1 to grade 12, I do not have any online resources that can support my studies. I have to rely on the textbook most of the time but it is hard for me to understand the content in these textbooks without help from teachers. And when I started to study at RMIT, I have an opportunity to use online learning for my studies and that is the time and realized that these online sources are so helpful. Therefore, I want Vietnamese students to also have a chance to get an advantage from online learning and all of my ideas for this application are come from this thought.
</p>
								</section>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Feature1: The Connection.</h3>
									<p>This application is a connection between every people because it allows parents, teachers, and students to create their own accounts. Specifically, each type of user has their own way to use it. For example, as a student, they can use the app to study, have a discussion with their friend, and asking teachers if there have any questions about their studies in school. As a teacher, through this application, they can also discuss with their students, support their students whenever they need and also contact their parents. Finally, as a parent, they can follow their child’s studies, their behavior at school through teacher’s feedback. This is very important, it seems like most of the parents spend most of the time working and forgot to notice how their child’s studies. Thus, this application will be the middle place where students, parents, and teachers can understand more about each other.
</p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Feature2: Online Admission.</h3>
									<p>After students enroll in their course, they can access a lot of course materials, including online listening, reading, videos, exercises, and many other learning resources. Back in the past, Vietnamese students can only learn from their textbooks and that means they always keep the textbooks with them if they want to study. This application will allow students to study whenever they want and wherever they stay with only their tablet, phone, or any other mobile devices.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Feature3: Interesting learning resources.</h3>
									<p>Students will probably find it is much more interesting when they use this application to study. For instance, students often feel bored in a literature class or history class. In order to help students find it more interested in these subjects, the application provides lots of videos, images about the story or historical event and avoid showing so many words which will easily make students hate studying. In addition, there are many mini-games that students can play with their classmates to review the lesson that they learn in class like a puzzle game.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Feature4: Easily manage your study.</h3>
									<p>By using this application, students may find it easier to manage their studies. The application includes a calendar and it will strongly suggest students make their own study schedule. Once students finished making their study schedule, every day, the application will notice the user what to do at certain times of the day. This is probably the key for students to get better learning results. Besides that, the app displays a list of achievements that students can see it as a goal to study. Students can get these achievements through the study activities and exercise in the application. Moreover, through students’ assignment scores and the result from the exercise of the app, it will base on the total result and show students what feature in study that they good at, are they on track or not, and what are their weak points that they need to be put in more effort.</p>

									<h3>Tools and Technologies.</h3>
									<p>To create an application, firstly I need a wireframing tool where I will take my sketch and my design ideas. This tool can help me plan, design and test my app. This wireframing tool can find in many websites like axure.com, balsamiq.com, pidoco.com or gliffy.com… Next, I need to define the Back End of my app and I can use some Back End services from websites such as parse, applicasa and kinvey. Then, I will start to build my app by using some app building platforms like biznessapps.com and kony.com . Designing the look will be the next step, I need to rely on some app design agencies such as bluemountainmedia.com. Finally, I can use Proto.io to test my App. These are some tools that need to create an app. Besides, I have to create a website that associated with my app for window users and to do that, I will use GitHub to create my app. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>Skill required.</h3>
									<p>There are some skills that I needed in order to execute the project like I need to know how to do Python, Java, or C++ projects and how to utilize HTML in order to create a website in GitHub. Those software that I looking for to do my project helps the user create their apps easier by using special tools that they provide. I think this project is quite feasible because I already have some software from the internet that can help me create my app. Moreover, I will soon study about some coding skills in Python and some other coding languages and some python project to practice my coding skills.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Outcome!</h3>
									<p>If my project is successful, a lot of students are able to get an advantage from EL. They can use EL as a tool to support their studies. By using this application, students will not need to rely on the textbook to study because studying from textbooks will be quite inconvenient sometimes. Furthermore, the app will improve the way of how students learn a lot because it has some tools that can help students manage their studying time. In addition, learning in EF might make students feel interested in studying and this will be the key to help students gain a better learning result.</p>
